##  Smart Agriculture - Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

**Project Overview**

This Smart Agriculture project leverages various machine learning models to:
- Recommend the most suitable **crop** to cultivate.
- Suggest the ideal **fertilizer** to use.

The recommendations are generated based on environmental and soil parameters, enhancing yield, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

 **Best Performing Models**

**XGBoost** models showed the highest performance, particularly in crop prediction, with superior precision, recall, and F1 scores.

**Next Steps â€“ Fault Detection Pipeline**

We are building a robust pipeline to detect sensor faults using:

1. **Abnormality Detection via PNN**
   - Classifies sensor readings as Normal or Faulty.

2. **Time-Aware Pattern Detection**
   - Models to analyze PNN outputs over time:
     -  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
     -  HMM (Hidden Markov Model)

 Fault Detection System â€“ Updated

To ensure data reliability from sensors, a robust fault detection mechanism has been implemented.

fault_labeling.ipynb
Implements the fault labeling algorithm.

Produces faulty_crop_dataset_labeled.csv containing labeled data with sensor status (Normal/Faulty).

fault_detection.ipynb
Combines:

PNN (Probabilistic Neural Network) for point-wise anomaly detection.

HMM (Hidden Markov Model) for time-aware fault pattern analysis.

This two-step pipeline helps isolate both instantaneous sensor faults and intermittent/temporal anomalies effectively.
